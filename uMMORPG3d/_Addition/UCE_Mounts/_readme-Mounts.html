<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This AddOn adds a complex Mount system to uMMORPG3d, that will allow players to ride mounts and travel the map 
	at increased speed. Mounts are summoned by using a special item and can be unsummonend using that item as well. 
	Mounts also come with various options and are able to attack enemies while unmounted.

<h2>Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Mounts are bound to special Mount items, you can create those items via the context menu.</li>
	<li>Each mount consists of 2 game objects, you have to create a game object for both: The unmounted mount as well as the mounted mount. You should use the provided example mounts as a base.</li>
	<li>Mounts have stats, you can easily edit them in the inspector. Check the inspector settings for more details. Only unmounted mounts have combat stats, as mounted mounts do not participate in combat.</li>
	<li>Unmounted mounts follow their owner around, just like pets, you can edit the settings in the inspector as well.</li>
	<li>Only unmounted mounts can participate in combat, make sure to edit the Collision layer matrix as described above or they wont react. Also edit their stats in the inspector.</li>
	<li>Mounts cannot gain experience or level up, but you can create multiple mount items and multiple mount game objects to create stronger variants.</li>
	<li>This feature also requires my PvP Realms AddOn installed: It is possible to allow players to attack and use skills while being mounted, but you can also dis-allow that on a per-skill basis. In order to do so, you have to check the "uncastable while mounted" checkbox that now appears next each skill.</li>
	<li>Be sure to check out the various options of Mounted Mounts, in order to make them move faster, optionally hide the player model, unmount the player when hit and more!</li>
</ul>
