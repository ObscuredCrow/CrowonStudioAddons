<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Enables players to place persistent objects in the game world. If the object is based on an Entity, it can also be 
	upgraded. Objects are saved permanently in the database, can optionally be picked up again and their placement can 
	be limited. This is very much like the build system found in RTS games like "Warcraft 3" (select building, select 
	spot, start to build, finish build, access building).
</p>

<h2>Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The Build System uses three parts: a Item (Scriptable Object) to spawn an object and a Game Object that represents the spawned object, plus a "Preview" object that is displayed to the player while the actual object is being built. You are encouraged to exchange the Game Object and it's Preview as you like. If your Game Object is based on a Entity (like a Monster etc.) your players can (optionally) also "upgrade" that object (just like a building in a RTS or Tower defense game). Upgrading will increase that game objects level by +1 and will increase it's stats.</li>
	<li>The Preview Objects can be simple Game Objects, they neither have to be Entities nor Network Identities, as they are only displayed client side to the local player.</li>
	<li>Game Objects placed using the Build System are saved server side and will be present forever. They re-appear when the server restarts. When such an object is set to "destroyable" and its health falls below 0 (or it is destroyed otherwise) - it will be deleted from the database as well. "Destroyable" only works in conjunction with objects that are based on the Entity class.</li>
	<li>The placement of Game Objects can optionally be limited to a "UCE RTS Build System Build Area". You will have to place such an area inside your scene and assign a ID number to it. Now assign the same ID number to any "Structure Item" and the Game Object that can be built by this item is limited to areas of that ID. That way you can limit where players can place certain objects.</li>
	<li>You can restrict the placement of Game Objects even more by limiting it to Areas that are owned by the Player and/or it's guild. This means your players will have to build a "Guild Area" / "Personal Area" first by placing it and then place a Game Object inside it. So first you let your players build their build areas and then they are allowed to build objects inside of it.</li>
	<li>This System uses any class based on "Entity" as it's base class for a placeable object - but it can also do without. In order for a placeable object to be upgradeable, it has to be a Entity - as only Entities offer a "level" variable. Of course you can use any class, so it can also be a Monster.</li>
	<li>If you want to use another class that is not a Monster, you will have to create your own class and derive it from Entity. With a bit of coding knowledge you can easily create a "Building" class for example. This might be added to this AddOn in the (far) future as default functionality.</li>
</ul>
